Module 2) Technology
● Discuss plans for upgrading your technology skills.
1. Dedicate time to reading around
As a student and when starting out in your career, it can be hard to find time to read anything beyond what’s required by 
your course. But if you want to get ahead professionally, you need to make the time for it. Stay in one night a week or may
be make it the thing you do on a Sunday morning before you go for a run. However you do it, scheduling a regular spot to 
start getting informed is going to make the process so much easier.
2. Identify your favourite tech-related media outlets
The great thing about all-things-tech is that there is simply so much great information available online for free. It’s the
nature of the beast. From Wired, Business Insider, Financial Times technology section, to TechCrunch, The Verge, Engadget,
there are so many easy ways to get informed. Don’t feel you have to read every last article. Surf around and see what attracts
you most.
3. Curate your own public profile
Make sure you’ve got the obvious ones - Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram - and then actively use them to post tech-
related media, whether articles, videos or blogposts. Hunt down and follow people who are writing things you can relate 
to about tech. Then go beyond the standard and start making yourself stand out - create a blog and write regular posts on
this about all things tech (and related) that are starting to garner your interest. You’re aiming for consistency of 
content and style. Remember this is something you’ll want prospective employers to look at as evidence of your growing 
interest.
4. Use tools to increase your own efficiency
Start using Doodle to find dates for your sports team’s training sessions instead of mailing the whole team and coordinating
responses. Stop ordering taxis over the phone and use an app instead. Do your banking using an app rather than in the 
branch. Try linking up your social media accounts (they each have simple descriptions on how to do this online), so you 
only post once - not four times. This will give you a better sense of the positive power of technology and save you time.
5. Analyse what you consume
We live in the age of smartphones. Start thinking about what you use on your phone / online and why. How does it help you?
What improvements were added in the recent update?  Why might these have been introduced? Is there anything you wish your 
favourite app could do but doesn’t? What do you think of the design? Is it clean and functional or playful and witty? 
How (well) does the design fit with the functionality? Keep a note of your musings in a table and refer back to it from 
time to time.
6. Start building your skill set
Learning at least a little bit of coding would be a fabulous thing for everyone, whether they are interested in working 
in tech or not. In doing this, you dispel the mystery cloaking this activity and realise it’s not too dissimilar to learning
maths or another language. Unless you’re desperate to become a coder, starting with HTML and CSS would suit you fine. 
Java and Ruby are good too, especially the latter as it’s so easy learn and used by loads of startups. In most cities and
 universities, there are plenty of clubs for aspiring developers, programmers, and designers. Check out Meetup to find one
near you. Or try an online course: check out MIT open courseware, Code Academy or Udemy. Bright Network's Technology 
Academy course on Python is a great way to learn a technical skill that will impress employers.
7. Experiment, experiment, experiment
If you set up your own blog, watch online tutorials (YouTube and Wordpress are goldmines of information) on how to make it
look spanglier. Try it out yourself. If someone in the family runs a small business, offer to build them a website. Again,
online tutorials are the place to start. Then, once you’ve got the website set up, try out doing some online advertising 
for them using Google Adwords. Or, if you’re a member of university society, be the one to run the Facebook page, make the
flyers that you post on it, create short videos on your phone to put the word out there about what you do and edit them 
using some free online tool  (Google really is your friend here). The more you do, the better a feel you will have for what
areas of tech-related work interest and excite you.
 
● Mention any relevant courses, certifications, or resources you are pursuing.
What is a certification?
Professional organizations award certifications to confirm that you have specific knowledge or skills needed to do a job.
Typically, you earn a credential after you've completed your education or gained experience through an internship, residency 
or time on the job.
Certification involves meeting specific standards and usually passing an exam. The credential is usually valid for a limited
time and must be renewed periodically. Employers may require that you achieve certification before being promoted or 
receiving a raise.
Certifications are more common in some occupations than others. Whether you need a certification may depend on your state,
employer, or the type of work you hope to do. It is different than a license, which is issued by a governmental agency 
giving legal authority to work in an occupation.
Certificates, certifications and licenses
You can add to your education and career options by obtaining various professional certificates, certifications or licenses
The terms sound similar, but they have different meanings and functions.
Certificates: A certificate may indicate you finished a vocational or educational program's coursework. They are not academic
degrees and do not certify you work in a particular occupation or industry. For example, you might receive a certificate 
for completing a management training program.
Certifications: A certification recognizes that you have the professional skills and education matching standardized criteria
for specific professional associations, companies or independent organizations. They are used as industry standards and may
be required for career advancement. For example, an accounting firm may require accountants to be Certified Public Accountants
(CPA). Certifications usually involve education and exam components and may require renewal every few years.
Licenses: A license is used by state governments, giving you authority to work in a specific field. They usually require 
an examination and proof of education and experience. For example, you have a state-issued license to be an electrician, 
doctor, teacher or plumber.
1. Project management certifications
Careers in project management continue to be in high demand, especially for those who hold the Certified Associate in Project
Management (CAPM) and Project Management Professional (PMP) certifications.
The associate-level CAPM is ideal for those with less experience in managing company projects but who still possess a solid
understanding of the field. The PMP certification is designed for professionals with a higher level of experience. Here are
the general steps to earning these certifications:
Possess a high school diploma, associate degree or equivalent.
Complete 1,500 hours of project experience or
Take 23 hours of project management education.
Pass a 150-question exam through the Project Management Institute (PHI).

● Share your approach to continuous learning and professional development.
Good answer: My approach to continuous learning and personal growth is to set clear goals and create a plan to achieve them.
I regularly attend relevant workshops, take online courses, and read industry publications to stay updated. I also seek feedback
from my colleagues to identify areas of improvement and work on them. I believe that continuous learning not only helps me
stay competitive in the job market but also helps me perform better at my job.
Bad answer: I don't really have a plan for continuous learning or personal growth. I just rely on my current knowledge and
experience to get by. I think my job tasks and duties will be enough to keep me learning.
This answer is bad because it shows a lack of interest and initiative in personal and professional development.
The answer projects a sense of contentment and complacency which is not attractive to most employers.
Good answer: My approach to continuous learning and personal growth is through self-reflection and feedback. I am always
reflecting on my performance and seeking feedback from my coworkers, mentors, and supervisors. I believe that feedback helps
me identify my strengths and weaknesses and informs the areas where I need to improve. When I receive feedback, I take
action to address any gaps in my knowledge or skills, and I look for opportunities to learn and grow through training and 
development programs.
Bad answer: Continuous learning is a waste of time and money. I think I know everything I need to know to excel at my job.
The company should focus on hiring talented individuals instead of investing in training.
This answer is bad because it demonstrates a rigid and negative attitude toward professional development and the employer's
investment in cultivating their workforce.
An employer will look for a candidate who values learning and is willing to invest in their development.
The answer also shows a closed attitude and lack of willingness to explore new knowledge and skills.
